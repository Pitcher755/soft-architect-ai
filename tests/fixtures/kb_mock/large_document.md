# Large Document for Chunking Tests

This document contains substantial content to test semantic chunking.

## First Major Section

This is the first section with detailed information.

### Subsection 1.1 - Detailed Analysis

More detailed content here with extended information to reach chunk size requirements. This section demonstrates how chunks are split based on semantic boundaries and content length. The semantic chunking algorithm analyzes headers, paragraphs, and content structure to create meaningful, cohesive text units.

### Subsection 1.2 - Further Details

Additional details for testing. This subsection contains more comprehensive analysis of the testing methodology. We need substantial content to ensure that semantic chunking properly respects document structure while also maintaining minimum and maximum chunk sizes. The algorithm should intelligently break down content at header boundaries when possible.

## Second Major Section

Starting the second major section with more comprehensive content. This section demonstrates advanced semantic chunking capabilities.

Content with more information and context. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

### Subsection 2.1 - Technical Details

Technical specifications and detailed implementation guidelines for the semantic chunking system. This includes considerations for different markdown structures, nested headers, code blocks, and special formatting. The implementation should handle edge cases gracefully while maintaining content coherence and searchability.

## Third Major Section

Concluding section with final thoughts on semantic chunking methodology. The system must balance between semantic coherence and practical chunk sizing constraints. This ensures that retrieved document chunks provide complete, meaningful information in RAG scenarios without excessive context overlap or content fragmentation.

## Fourth Major Section - Additional Content

Extended content to ensure document reaches sufficient size for multiple chunk generation. Comprehensive information about advanced features and implementation details.
